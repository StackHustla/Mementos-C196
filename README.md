This mobile application serves as a virtual student portal, enabling users to manage their academic information.
Users can seamlessly add, edit, or remove semesters, courses, tests, and professors.

The application is designed for both portrait and landscape orientations, specifically optimized for smartphones rather than tablets.
Notably, it features alarm settings and allows users to send predefined text messages. Under the hood, the application utilizes
a ROOM database for efficient data management and offers an intriguing feature to prepopulate the database with data inspired by the "Persona 5" universe.
